# Pebble OG Watch game Hopper

Hopper was a simple isometric collect-em-up (did I just invent a genre?) for [Pebble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pebble_(watch)) OG smartwatches. I wrote this game in a day as an experiment to play around with the Pebble SDK. Since both the Company and Platform are largely defunct I have open sourced the code in the hope someone might find it useful.

In the game you are a penguin who hops (hence Hopper) from isometric tile to tile collecting gems while trying to avoid skeletons who both want to steal the gems and pinch the ones you've already collected.

The level ends when all the gems are collected and a new level is randomly generated.

The game is still available on the community maintained [Rebble app store](https://apps.rebble.io/en_US/application/5427e6c176741fd40c000086).
